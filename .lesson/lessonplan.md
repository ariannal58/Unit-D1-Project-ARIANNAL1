# Unit D1 Project
  
In this project, you will create a student information system for a small school. 
## Minimum Functionality (passing grade)
* [3] Store the names listed in the attached doc in project memory, with the first names stored in separate Arrays/ArrayLists from the last names and grades.
* [2] The program will give the user a menu of actions that she can do.
* [2] The user may enter a new name and grade into the program and print out a list of all the names and grades.
* [2] The user may search for a name and determine where it is stored in the program.
* [3] The user may alphabetize the lists by the students' last names. A partially-alphabetized list will only receive 1 or 2 pts.
* [1] Submit the project in both Replit.com and Google Classroom by the deadline.
## Advanced Functionality
* [3] The user may enter Spring grades for all the students by showing a student name and asking for a grade. The program will output the list of students and grades showing the new grades.
* [2] The user may search for a student by name (either first or last) and alter a grade for that student. The program will print out that student's name and new grade.
* [2] The user may delete a student from the program, and all elements of that student (first name, last name, grades) will be removed. The program will print out the list of students and their grades to show that only that student has been removed.
* Extra Credit [5] You are able to design the program so that it will be able to complete each task without having to re-run the program.
